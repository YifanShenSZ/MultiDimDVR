# MultiDimDVR
Multi-dimensional DVR solver for cartesian coordinates.

It is used to construct and evaluate eigenvalues of multi-dimensional DVR Hamiltonian (in sinc functions basis) instead of quantum dynamics.

This program is based on c++11 standard.

Eigen3 package is required, which can be downloaded from http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page
